# Blockchain-Project
A Python implementation of Blockchain Technology for the course BITS F452.

The team members are Anish Kacham, Amogh Bharadwaj and Kevin Biju Kizhake Kanichery.

For Assignment 2, we have implemented a consensus algorithm, namely the **Proof of Elapsed Time** algorithm.

Specialties:
1) A decentralised multinode blockchain network with a command-line interface.
2) Weights for validity votes for transactions. 
3) Merkle Tree hashing introduced for block validation. 
4) Longest chain rule algorithm coded for future use.

Consensus-specific features:
1) Simulated an asynchronous waiting session for the nodes.
2) Prepared a secure storage for the algorithm's source code.
 

Run the **Launch.py** program to begin validating transactions.
